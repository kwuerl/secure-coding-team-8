\subsection{THC Hydra}
THC Hydra is a password cracking tool which implements brute force attack on Network Login. It performs a dictionary attack and supports more than 50 protocols such as telnet, ftp, http, https, smb, pop3, imap etc. \\
It has two options for password attacks:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Generating passwords by Brute Force approach based on character length.
    \item Using a dictionary file containing commonly used passwords. Accuracy and speed of this tool largely depends on the dictionary since other factors like network connection and processing speed are not big issues anymore.
\end{itemize}
Example:

\begin{lstlisting}
hydra -L testuser@test.com -p Top500.txt
    <IP-address> http-post-form
    'secure-coding/public/login.php:email=testuser@test.com
    \&password=\^PASS\^ \&submit=:Invalid login credentials'
\end{lstlisting}
