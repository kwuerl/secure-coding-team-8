    \textbf{Observation} & 
    	The Session is terminated by PHP after the standard value of 1440s inactivity.
    \\
    \textbf{Discovery} & 
    	We guessed that the Session timeout was not changed and tried if the session was still active after 23 and 25 minutes.
    	The results lead to the conclusion that the Session is automatically terminated by PHP after the standart value of 1440s inactivity.
    	No timeout value is specified in the cookie.
