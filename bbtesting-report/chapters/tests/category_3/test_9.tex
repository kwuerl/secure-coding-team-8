\subsection{Testing for weak password change or reset functionalities - OTG-AUTHN-009}
\subsubsection{BANK-APP}
\begin{longtable}[l]{ p{2.3cm} | p{.79\linewidth} }\hline
    & \textbf{BANK-APP} \\ \hline
    \textbf{Observation} & It has been observed that the functionality for Password change or reset is absent in the application and hence this vulnerability could not be tested. \\
    \textbf{Discovery} & N/A \\
    \textbf{Likelihood} & N/A \\
    \textbf{Impact} & N/A \\
    \textbf{Recommen\-dations} & It is recommended to implement the reset and change password functionalities to handle scenarios such as user forgetting the password, password known to other people etc. Also, the authorization to perform these operations should lie with the user and the administrator only. \\ \hline
    \textbf{CVSS} & N/A
    \\ \hline
\end{longtable}

\subsubsection{SecureBank}
\begin{longtable}[l]{ p{2.3cm} | p{.79\linewidth} }\hline
    & \textbf{SecureBank} \\ \hline
    \textbf{Observation} & It has been observed that the functionality for Password change or reset is absent in the application and hence this vulnerability could not be tested. \\
    \textbf{Discovery} & N/A \\
    \textbf{Likelihood} & N/A \\
    \textbf{Impact} & N/A \\
    \textbf{Recommen\-dations} & Same as described for BANK-APP. \\ \hline
    \textbf{CVSS} & N/A
    \\ \hline
\end{longtable}

\subsubsection{Comparison}
Both the applications do not have the implementation for password change or reset.
