Possible Security Risks

-> HTML Form Submission    : Verifying + Sanitizing form fields

-> Sending Emails          : Email Injection => Verifying + Sanitizing parameters for mail function 

-> Database Operations     : SQL Injection => Use mysqli or PDO 

-> File Upload

-> File Parsing

-> Code generation         : Vulnerabilites with random number generation => random_bytes is preferred
