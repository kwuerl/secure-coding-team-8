\subsection{RATS}
RIPS was used to scan PHP code, mainly for security-related programming errors.

\subsubsection{InternetBanking }
RATS did not show any problems with the PHP code of InternetBanking application.

\subsubsection{SecureBank}
RATS reported 5 issues in the PHP code of SecureBank, out of which 1 was of high severity. See \ref{fig:rats_overview_secure_bank}.
The issue was with the usage of the \code{mail} function of PHP. However, upon analyzing the code, it was found that the parameters to the function were not derived from user input. Hence this turned to be a false positive.
The other low severity suspicions were also confirmed to be false positives after manual code inspection.
