\subsection{Valgrind}
Valgrind was used for automatically detecting memory management bugs in the C executable. The command used was \code{valgrind --leak-check=full <command for parser>}.

It was used primarily to detect the number of allocations and freed blocks. For both application it showed that more heaps were allocated than freed. Refer to section~\ref{buffer_overflow} for more information.
