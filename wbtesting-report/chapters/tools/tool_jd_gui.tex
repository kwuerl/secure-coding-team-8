\subsection{JD-GUI - Java Decompiler}
JD-GUI was used for decompilation of the SCS JAR. The code generated was not immediately executable as the tool does not handle few aspects such as usage of final variables in inner classes. Hence the code had to be manually inspected to yield actual executable source code. Refer section \ref{java_scs_decompilation} for more information.
