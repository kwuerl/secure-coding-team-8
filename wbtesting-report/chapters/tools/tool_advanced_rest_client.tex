\subsection{Advanced Rest Client (Chrome Extension)}
Advanced Rest Client is a Chrome extension which helps in creating custom HTTP requests. It gives the option of editing the request methods such as GET, POST, HEAD etc. It thereby allows the user for HTTP Verb Tampering. It also provides the option of testing file uploads. We used this to try various custom requests and confirm the presence of vulnerabilities found.\\
