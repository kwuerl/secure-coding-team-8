    \textbf{Observation} &
        It has been found that it is possible to enter valid data and cause the application to behave differently due to a deviation in the business logic. Two such vulnerabilities have been found and they are as follows.
        \begin{itemize}
            \item In the Transaction page, it is possible to perform a transfer to own account. This transfer also reflects in the Transaction History but does not affect the Account Balance in any way.
            \item In the Account Details page, employee can reset the balance of any customer to 0 repeatedly and thus prevent the customer from performing any transactions at all.
        \end{itemize}
    \\
    \textbf{Discovery} & By checking the code, there was no code related to checking transfer to self. \\
    \textbf{Likelihood} & Likelihood is high. The attacker need not have any technical knowledge to perform this action. \\
    \textbf{Impact} & It is possible to deny performing transfers by setting the balance to 0 infinite number of times. \\
    \textbf{Recommen\-dations} &
        \begin{itemize}
        \item Transfer to self should be restricted.
        \item Balance initialization should be restricted to a specific number of attempts.
        \end{itemize}

    \textbf{Observation} & It has been found that there are appropriate checks to validate all data and hence no vulneranbility has been found in this regard. \\
    \textbf{Discovery} & By manually inspecting the code, validations during transfer, balance initialization. Balance initialization is also a one-time process. After the emloyee has set the balance of an employee once, it cannot be done again. \\
    \textbf{Likelihood} & N/A \\
    \textbf{Impact} & N/A \\

\subsubsection{Comparison}
SecureBank is better than Online Banking as it does not allow circumvention of work-flow in the application.
