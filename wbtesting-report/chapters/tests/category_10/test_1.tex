    \textbf{Observation} & DOM based XSS uses the DOM present in the source as injection points. We tried to manipulate URLs to explore this vulnerability. However, no criticality was detected. \\
    \textbf{Discovery} & We scanned the code using \code{grep} for \code{document.location.href} and \code{window.location} in Javascript but none were found. We also confirmed by manually appending strings such as \code{\#<script>alert('hi')</script>} to URLs. After refreshing this page with this value, no changes were observed. \\
