    \textbf{Observation} & It has been observed that CSS injections cannot be performed as user inputs are sanitized. Hence we cannot inject html tags which could be used to execute scripts indirectly. \\
    \textbf{Discovery} & Manual inspection of code revealed usage of functions such as \code{htmlspecialchars}, \code{filter\_var} and \code{preg\_match} for input sanitization. \\

\subsubsection{Comparison}
Neither application is vulnerable to this attack since all inputs are properly sanitized.
