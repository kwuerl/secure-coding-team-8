    \textbf{Observation} & It was found that Cross Origin Resource Sharing is not possible since the \code{Access-Control-Allow-Origin} header was not set in the requests and hence the application does not support cross origin requests. \\
    \textbf{Discovery} &
        Though a Javascript code snippet was written to test for CORS support, we were not able to simulate cross site requests directly. Refer \ref{code:test_cors} for the code snippet.
        Hence we used the \enquote{test-cors.org} website to make a request to the application and it failed with the error that the header \code{Access-Control-Allow-Origin} was missing. See Figure \ref{fig:test_cors}. The header should have been set to * or some domain in order to serve cross domain requests.

\subsubsection{Comparison}
Neither of the applications support cross domain requests and hence this vulnerability does not exist.
