    \textbf{Observation} & In the application, the same session cookie \code{PHPSESSID} is used everywhere. Hence there is no case of session overloading. Since the same session cookie is used, it can be leveraged to bypass authentication. Refer section \ref{OTG-SESS-003} for details about session hijacking. \\

\subsubsection{Comparison}
Both the applications behave similarly in maintaining a single session cookie, and no vulnerability has been found with respect to session overloading/puzzling.
