    \textbf{Observation} &
       We could not detect any possibilities of privilege escalation.
    \\
    \textbf{Discovery} &
       Controller functions are properly prepended by access right checks.
       Where the Users Id is used in code it is taken from the session and not from GET or POST parameters.
       There is no functionality accessible for the Client that allowes write access to the Clients data.
       It has been implemented in \code{clientController.php} and \code{employeeController.php} based on session values. Refer \ref{code:client_check} for code related to client check and \ref{code:employee_check} for code related to employee check based on session value. \\

    \textbf{Observation} &
       We could not detect any possibilities of privilege escalation.
    \\
    \textbf{Discovery} &
       Each controller function is prepended by an access right check, that checks for the current users static and contextual privileges.
       Where the Users Id is used in code it is taken from the session and not from GET or POST parameters.
       Refer \ref{code:customer_check_secure_bank} for code related to customer check and \ref{code:employee_check_secure_bank} for code related to employee check based on session value. Similar checks are implemented for all client, employee and administrator operations.
