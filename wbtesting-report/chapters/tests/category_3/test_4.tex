    & \textbf{Online Banking} \\ 
    \hline
    \textbf{Observation} &
        There were several observations:
        \begin{itemize}
          \item Direct Page access is not possible
          \item Parameter modification is not possible
          \item Session ID Prediction is not possible
          \item SQL Injection is not possible in the Login form
        \end{itemize}
    \\
    \textbf{Discovery} &
        As Online Banking uses the standard PHP 5.3 way of generating Session IDs it is not vulnerable to Session ID Prediction. \newline
        Parameter modification was eliminated by manually looking at the url parameters in the app. \newline
        For SQL Injection please refer to OTG-INPVAL-005 \newline
        For direct page access we used curl to mannually revisit pages without an active session. \newline

\subsubsection{Comparison}
Online Banking contains a very weak authentification mechanism as direct page access is possible for almost every page.
SecureBank does not seem to have this security flaws.
