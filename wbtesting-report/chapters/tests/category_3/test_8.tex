\subsection{Testing for Weak security question/answer - OTG-AUTHN-008}
\begin{longtable}[l]{ p{2.3cm} | p{.79\linewidth} }\hline
    & \textbf{Online Banking} \\ \hline
    \textbf{Observation} & It is noted that the functionality for retrieving password based on security question(s) is not implemented in the application. Hence this vulnerability could not be tested. \\
    \textbf{Discovery} & N/A \\
    \textbf{Likelihood} &  N/A \\
    \textbf{Impact} & N/A \\
    \textbf{Recommen\-dations} & It would be advisable to implement the functionality to retrieve password based on security question(s). Self generated or application generated question(s) can be used, after registration. These question(s) should be secure enough to avoid data compromise to the attacker. Answers to these can be used at the time of password retrieval. \\

\subsubsection{Comparison}
Both the applications do not have the implementation for security question(s).
