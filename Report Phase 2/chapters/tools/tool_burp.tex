\subsection{Burp Suite}
Burp Suite is a Java application which is used to secure or penetrate web applications. The suite consists of different tools, such as a proxy server, a web spider, intruder and repeater. As a proxy server, the traffic that passes through it can be manipulated by the user, i.e. between the web browser and the web server. This is typically a Man-in-the-Middle(MITM) type attack architecture. As a spider , it scans the targeted host and creates a layout of various pages and website parameters.
