\subsection{FireForce (FireFox Add on)}
FireForce is a Firefox extension which helps in performing brute force attacks on GET and POST forms. It has two options.
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Generate password} : It has different options such as minimum and maximum number of characters required, message identifying success/failure in login etc. Based on the number of characters, the tool may take few minutes to many hours to identify the password.
    \item \textbf{Load Dictionary} : The tool gives the option of loading passwords from a file. It helps us to use commonly used passwords that are available online for brute force attack.
\end{itemize}
However, this tool did not yield expected results when used in our testing.
