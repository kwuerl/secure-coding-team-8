    \textbf{Observation} & No CSRF tokens were used for HTML forms. \\
    \textbf{Discovery} & Using the developer tools of Chrome or Firefox the HTML forms were examined. The results showed that no CSRF tokens were used. \\
    \textbf{Likelihood} & The hacker needs to know the structure of a request and has to find a way to make the user use the fake request. \\
    \textbf{Impact} & The attacker could force the user to execute the requests on the user account. \\

\subsubsection{Comparison}
Both bank applications do not use any mechanisms against CSRF and are therefore both vulnerable to CSRF.
