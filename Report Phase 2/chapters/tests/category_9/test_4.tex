    	The only siginificant timing abnormaly we could discover was on the customer approval functionality.
    	We could not identify this as a thread.
    \\
    \textbf{Discovery} & 
    	We checked page load times unsing the Google Chrome Developer Tools to determine time abnormalities.
    	Most page load times where between 10ms and 40ms, the approve user action took about 1600ms.
