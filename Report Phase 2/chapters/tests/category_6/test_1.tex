\begin{longtable*}{p{.20\textwidth} | p{.80\textwidth}}
    \hline
    & \textbf{BANK-APP} \\
    \hline
    \textbf{Observation} &
      It has been found that Reflected Cross Site Scripting is not possible in the application. None of the URLs that we tried to append script tags to; were not successful, since the corresponding page was not displayed properly.
    \\\\
    \textbf{Discovery} &
        No tools were needed to discover this vulnerability. The URLs need to be modified and parameters set to some script tag.
    \\\\
    \textbf{Impact} &
        NA
    \\\\
    \textbf{CVSS} &

    \textbf{Observation} &
        It has been verified that Reflected Cross Site Scripting is not possible. All the URLs where we tried to append script tags returned the response as 404.
