\subsection{Test Role Definitions - OTG-IDENT-001}
We identified four different role definitions: \textbf{Admin}, \textbf{Employee}, \textbf{Customer}, \textbf{Anyone}.
Possibly the \textbf{Admin} and the \textbf{Employee} can be combined.
According to the specification the four roles should have the following permissions:

		We Observed, that Employees are capable of all actions, that users are allowed to perform.
		This leads to a state where Employees acting as Customers are able to approve their own transactions.
    \\\\
    \textbf{Discovery} &
    	We examined the Application by manually following the provided links and UI elements
    \\\\
    \textbf{Likelihood} &
    	As the Customer functionalities can be freely used by Employees the likelihood of abuse is higher than it would be if employees had to use seperate user accounts for their private transactions.
    \\\\
    \textbf{Impact} &
    	The impact of the availability of customer functionality for employees includes the possibility of unsupervised transfers of large sums issued employees.
    	This increases the risk of money laundering.
