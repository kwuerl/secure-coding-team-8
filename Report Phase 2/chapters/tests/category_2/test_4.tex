    \textbf{Observation} & It was found that the application responds with the same error messages for every client request that produces a failed authentication. This has been tested in the Login page. \\
    \textbf{Discovery} &
         This test was performed manually by trying various combinations of email and password. Steps are as follows:
            \begin{itemize}
            \item \textbf{Scenario 1 -} Testing for Valid user with right password
            		\begin{itemize}
            		 \item Open the Login page and enter a valid email and password. Click on the Submit button.

            		 \item The user is redirected to the Transactions page without any success message.
            		\end{itemize}
             \item \textbf{Scenario 2 -} Testing for Valid user with wrong password
             	\begin{itemize}
             	  \item Open the Login page and enter a valid email with an incorrect password. Click on the Submit button.

             	  \item An error message is displayed that reads \code{Invalid Login Credentials}, and the user stays on Login page. Also, the data entered in the form is cleared off.
             	\end{itemize}

            \item \textbf{Scenario 3-} Testing for non-existent User
     	       \begin{itemize}
     	       \item Open the Login page and enter an incorrect email and password. Click on the Submit button.

     	       \item An error message is displayed that reads \code{Invalid Login Credentials}, and the user stays on Login page. Also, the data entered in the form is cleared off.
     	       \end{itemize}
            \end{itemize}

    \textbf{Observation} & It was found that the application responds with the same error message - \code{Login failed}, for every client request that produces a failed authentication. This has been tested in the Login page. \\
    \textbf{Discovery} & The behavior is similar in our application as well; and the vulnerability cannot be exploited as the error messages are consistent for all incorrect requests. \\

\subsubsection{Comparison}
Both applications exhibit similar behavior with respect to account enumeration and neither contain any vulnerabilty.
