    \textbf{Observation} & It has been observed that authentication is only based on a combination of Email id \& password and that account names are not implemented in the application. This has been tested in the Login and Registration pages. Enumeration of Email id \& password is already described in section \ref{OTG-IDENT-004}. \\
