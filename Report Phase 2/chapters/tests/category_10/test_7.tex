    \textbf{Observation} &
      It was found that Cross Origin Resource Sharing is not possible since the  'Access-Control-Allow-Origin' header was not set in the requests and hence the application does not support cross origin requests.
    \\\\
    \textbf{Discovery} &
        Though a Javascript code snippet was written to test for CORS support, we were not able to simulate cross site requests directly. Following is the code: 
        Hence we used test-cors.org site to make a request to the application and it failed with the error that the header "Access-Control-Allow-Origin" was missing. See Figure \ref{fig:test_cors}.
        The header should have been set to * or some domain in order to serve cross domain requests.

    \textbf{Observation} &
        Same behavior could be observed in the application since the same header was missing in the responses.

    Same as described for BANK-APP.
